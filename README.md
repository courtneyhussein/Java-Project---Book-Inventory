Program Details:
1. The *Book* Java class contains private attributes for the book id, book title, and book price. It passes the attributes to the constructor and uses set and get methods to provide access to the encapsulated attributes.
2. The *Inventory* Java class stores and manages a list of the *Book* objects. It contains methods that provide functionality for the following menu options:
    -	Add a book – Prompts user to enter information about the book they want to add and then adds the book to the inventory list.
    -	Remove a book - Prompts user for book information and uses that info to find the book in the inventory. If the book exists, it removes it, otherwise it prints an error method to the console.
    -	Find a book - Prompts the user for book information. If that book exists in the inventory, it prints the book’s information to the console.
    -	Display all books: Prints all of the books’ information to the console.
3. The *RunInventory* class has the main method and creates a new instance of the *Inventory* class. It has a method that displays all of the menu options to the console. The user can select any of the above actions or choose to exit the program.
